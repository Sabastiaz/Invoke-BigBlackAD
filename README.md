## 🧙 What is this?

`Invoke-BigBlackAD` is a **critical Active Directory pentesting tool** that should be deployed immediately when:

- BloodHound is confused 🐕
- SharpHound is crying 😭
- PowerView is shaking 😰
- You have no idea what you're doing 💀
- The Domain Admin is escaping 🏃

This tool solves **all** of the above by **summoning Big Black** — the legendary AD whisperer who will have you owning that domain in no time.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is an **inside joke** created for our pentesting team. It does not perform any actual Active Directory enumeration, exploitation, or reconnaissance. Any resemblance to a real security tool is purely for comedic effect.

Please do not use this on client engagements. Unless the client asks why you're opening Facebook mid-pentest. Then it's their fault.
